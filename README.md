QuadrInoFly

QuadrInoFly is a Quadcopter flight controller, based on Arduino UNO.
This is one of my final years student projets, as software engineer specialize in embedded system.
Passionate about UAV & quadcopter, I wanted to recreate my proper flight controller to learn & understand how it works.

OBJECTIF

The primary objective is to realize, thanks to digital feedback control, the quadcopter's pitch attitude.

GETTING STARTED

This project is developping on the Arduino project,
so to run it, you just need to get you the Arduino IDE.
