QuadrInoFly

QuadrInoFly is a Quadcopter flight controller, based on Arduino UNO.
This project, one of my projects of the end of my studies of embedded software engineer.
Passionate about UAV & quadcopter, I wanted to recreate my proper flight controller to learn & understand how it works.

OBJECTIF

The primary objective is to realize, thanks to numeric asservissement, the quadcopter's pitch attitude.

GETTING STARTED

This project is developping on the Arduino project,
so to run it, you just need to get you the Arduino IDE.
